## Salmon
- Salmon spawn in rivers, where total return is the combined total of escapement from fishery and the amount of fish harvested from fishery (total return = escapement + total catch)
- Data was given in Bristol Bay, AK to look at escapement and total return reports from 1956 to 2020 for select fishing districts in Bristol Bay, AK.
